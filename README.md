# Social-media-back-end
In this project, I have developed a Flask-based social media platform similar to Twitter (now X). 
Users can post content with images or just blog text. The platform allows users to follow/unfollow others, like/unlike posts, and add or delete comments.
MOreover, application uses Flask-Bcrypt for password hashing and JWT tokens for authorization
