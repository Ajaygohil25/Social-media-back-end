Social media back end application 
I have developed a Flask-based social media platform similar to Twitter (now X). 
Users can post content with images or just blog text. The platform allows users to follow/unfollow others, like/unlike posts, and add or delete comments.
Additionally, users have a feed to view posts from those they follow, and they can access information about their followers and followings, as well as manage their profile.
The application uses Flask-Bcrypt for password hashing and JWT tokens for authorization.
